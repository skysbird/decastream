# DecaStream

ðŸš€ A fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, open live streaming network.

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

DecaStream aims to be the Web3-native infrastructure for livestreaming. Unlike centralized platforms, it allows anyone to broadcast without permission, censorship, or cost limitationsâ€”by contributing to the network.

### Core Principles:
- **Free to stream**: Anyone can start pushing a livestream without paying.
- **Incentive to contribute**: Users who provide transcoding or storage nodes earn tokens.
- **No central server**: All content is pushed, encoded, and distributed through community nodes.
- **Token-governed economy**: Streamers either contribute or pay small tokens to use network resources.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

### Modules:

- **Ingest Gateway**: Accept RTMP/SRT/WHIP live inputs from OBS or any streaming software.
- **Transcoding Node**: Docker container that takes live stream, encodes to HLS/DASH at multiple bitrates.
- **Distributed Storage**: IPFS or other decentralized networks to cache segments for viewers.
- **Viewer Player**: Web app or desktop player that supports HLS and IPFS protocols.
- **Blockchain Layer**: Ethereum-compatible smart contracts for rewarding contributors.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/decastream/decastream`
2. Run your first node: `cd node/transcode-node && docker compose up`
3. Push RTMP stream to the gateway.
4. Watch from the decentralized web player.
