# Project Vision - DecaStream

## 🌍 Why We Exist

Today’s live streaming platforms are:
- Centralized and censored
- Paywalled or ad-supported
- Shut down your stream any time
- Offer no reward to infrastructure contributors

**DecaStream** is a protocol-level initiative to build an unstoppable, censorship-resistant, peer-driven streaming network.

## 🧭 Mission

To enable **anyone** to broadcast **freely**, without platform control, using a **network of community-run nodes**.

## 🔥 Core Principles

- **Permissionless**: Push your stream without asking for approval.
- **Open**: All software and protocols are open-source.
- **Rewarded**: Run a node? You earn.
- **Composable**: Can plug into existing wallets, identities, and clients.

## 💬 Use Cases

- Livestream from war zones, protests, disaster areas
- Run indie sports channels or 24/7 chill streams
- Build your own decentralized Twitch on top
